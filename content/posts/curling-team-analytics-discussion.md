Summary of terms

Thanks to Gerry gurts from curlingzone for creating these.

I want to address the distribution of teams with respect to the metrics given that curling strategy implies trade offs.

Level of defensiveness or agression defines a space between
- too agressive and score 2 more but also give up more steals
- too defensive securing your point with hammer (or blanking) but not scoring 2

When a team has hammer:

First some definitions on terms

When a team has hammer:
Hammer Efficiency - The percentage of ends in which a team scores 2 or more points when they have the hammer. Excluding blanks. Higher is better.
Steal Defense - The percentage of times a team gives up a steal when they have hammer. Lower is better.

When a team does not have hammer:
Force Efficiency - The percentage of times a team forces the opponent to take 1 when they do not have the hammer. Higher is better.
Steal Efficiency - The percentage of ends in which a team steals a point when they do not have the hammer. Excluding blanks. Higher is better.


Chart Hammer efficiency vs Steal defense
Hammer efficiency is dependent variable = we look at team strategy aimed at scoring 2 or more with hammer, steal defense is bonus.
Quadrants
Bottom left - low hammer efficiency and high steal defense. Team often scores 1 or blanks with hammer. Defensive team.
Top left - low hammer efficiency and low steal defense. Team with poor execution or poor strategy.
Bottom right - high hammer efficiency and high steal defense. Elite team. Highest execution + expert strategy. Team that scores 2 or more with hammer and does not give up steals. Aggressive team.
Top right - high hammer efficiency and low steal defense. Team that scores 2 or more with hammer but also gives up steals. Agressive but with execution or strategy flaws.

If our premise is that the team's strategy is focused on scoring 2 then 

If I focus my game on hammer effiicency (dependent variable)
we see a region in the top right where I am 


Chart Force efficiency vs Steal efficiency
Force efficiency is dependent variable = we look at team strategy aimed at ensuring a force, steal is bonus.
Quadrants
Bottom left - Team doesn't force and doesn't steal. Losing team. Execution or strategy flaws. 
Top left - 
Bottom right 
Top right


What about comparing hammer to non hammer situations?


What if we assume all teams have constant execution. That is, they make 100% of the called shot exactly as called?
How might we gain some insight into the strategy called?
