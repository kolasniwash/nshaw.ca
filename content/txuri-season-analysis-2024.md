## Season Analytic Summary
Analytics are broken into two categories: game stats and playing stats.

Game stats look at our aggregate performance in competition. They measure as a proxy how we perform against competition as whole. We can use them to infer strengths and weaknesses in terms of offense and defense.

Playing stats look at our ability to make shots as called. These are available aggregated at the team level, and individual levels down to shot type, and position. These stats help us understand strenghts and weaknesses of each player. They also help us understand the kind of shot distribution that is typical of each position based on the strategy we are calling as a team. When looked at in aggregate (i.e. team shooting percentage) these stats show the effect of moving players to different positions.

#### Lineup Legend
Abbreviation and description for lineups starting in playing order lead to skip. The column 'Effect of NOT on ICE' indicates the lineup is measuring the relative performance of the team lineup without that player. When we see differences between lineups we are measuring a proxy the contribution of that missing player to the overall team shooting percentage.

| NEMS     | Nico, Edu, Mikel, Sergio          | Luis                   |
