## Observations
- In-turn preference
  - Team always gives Angel major in-turns on his draws.
    - Whole game against Txuri was played toward in-turn side.
  - Team prefers in turn hits. Even on center line observed preferring in-turn.

- Freeze preference
  - Anything behind the t-line they will try to freeze.
  - Groups of three stones are often frozen to or tapped back.
  - Especially late in the end with Angelito's rocks.
    - Often cuts down scoring from an "easy" 2+ to a hard shot for 2.
