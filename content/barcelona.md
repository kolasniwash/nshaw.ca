## Observations
- Draws 
  - Weight control is all over the place. Often go for draw and end with a (useful_) guard, or go for guard and end with a (good) draw behind.
  - Careful giving them the same draw twice.
  - Draw placement tolerance is good.
- Hits
  - Tolerance is poor. Refer to stats.
- Strategy
  - Scoring / stealing when _opponent_ allows rocks to build up
  - Poor idea of how to set up an end on first rocks
  - Knows to play clearing / remove guards in last ends when winning.
    - Switched 8th end at vice second rock to start playing draws behind instead of peeling when up by 2.
  - Up by 2 playing 6th put up a center guard and came around instead of hitting opponent open rock (same on seconds first rock)
